INTRODUCTION                                                *Board-Introduction*


This plugin introduces a file type `board`, where you can easily erase and write
summaries, links to directories and files, and some additional commands.


Feature 1~

 After assigning a '`key`' to the plugin, you can take quick notes on the board
 at any time while editing using:
>
      Key Enter
<
 and to return:
>
      Key Esc
<
Feature 2~
 You can easily define shortcuts to directories or files on the board as simple
 `key-path` pairs. For example:
>
      dt  ~/Documents/Terms/
      v   ~/.vimrc
<
 Immediately after saving, you can use the following key sequences to change the
 current working directory, or open the file:
>
      Key dt
      Key v
<
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONFIGURATION                                              *Board-Configuration*

The first step is to define a directory to store the `board` files. The plugin
default path is:
>
    let BoardPath = '~/.vim/after/vim-board'
<
The next step is to assign a convenient key to bring up the `board` with the `menu`.
The plugin default shortcut is `a single quote and space` if available.
>
    nmap '<Space> <Plug>(BoardMenu)
<
Now, save the changes and reload the configuration.
>
 At this point, you can try out the features in the introduction section above.
<
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MENU                                                                *Board-Menu*

Pressing the `BoardMenu` key will bring up the most recently used `board` with the
`menu`.
>
    Board (-)prev(=)main(+)new(;)return  _
<
You can enter the key defined on the `board` to change the working directory or
open the file, or you can switch between boards using the following keys:

        <Enter>   edit current board
         <Esc>    return
           ;      return
        <Space>   scroll down
         <Down>   scroll down
          <Up>    scroll up
       <C-Space>  scroll up
           -      switch to previous board
           =      switch to main board
           +      add new board
           .      link current board
           :      command-line mode

For manually opened boards, you can use `(.)link` menu with the `.` key to activate
links defined on the board.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOARD SYNTAX                                                      *Board-Syntax*

The `board` file syntax is relatively simple. You can use indentation and some
leading characters to mark each item differently.

Section ~

 The plugin uses sections to categorize content. Each section starts at the
 beginning of a line, and can have different syntax depending on its type.
>
  Section
      Group
          TEXT
<
:Links section ~

 The plugin loads links defined in this section. The following example defines
 two links:
>
        /p  ~/Languages/Python/
        pn  ~/Languages/Python/notes.py
<

 Each link is a simple space-separated `key-path` pair, and uses the same
 indentation as the `TEXT` field starting at column 6 or higher.

 Commands ~
    You can also add additional commands using `|` bar. For example, to update
    the `NERDTree` list after changing the current working directory: >

        /p  ~/Languages/Python/ | NERDTreeCWD
<
    After opening the file, to scroll line 128 to the top:
>
        pn  ~/Languages/Python/notes.py | 128 | normal! zt
<
    When switching to another board stored in the |BoardPath| directory, you can
    omit the path and specify only the file name. For example:
>
        'r  reference.board
        /r  ~/Reference/Code/Library/ | reference.board | Hi:load reference
<
 Key ~
    A key can consist of any combination of symbols, alphanumeric, and Unicode
    characters except those that start with some predefined characters.

    Available leading characters:~
      ~!@$%^_()[]{}<>'"/?,0-9a-zA-Z and Unicode characters

    Used in the syntax      Used in the menu~
        #  comment             ;  return
        :  setting             -  previous
        |  command             =  main
        *` special             +  new
        -  plain text          .  load
        &  reference           :  command

    You can also define the same key differently on each board.

    Tip ~
    When you suddenly have multiple to-do lists, numbering can be useful.
>
        t1  ~/Todo/file1 | /item | echo ' find item'
        t2  ~/Todo/dir2/ | echo ' add file2'
<
    Long key ~
    You only need to enter the unique prefix part of the key. For example, if
    you define a long key `xylophone` and don't have a key that starts with `xy`,
    you can open the link with `xy` <Enter>.

 Path ~
    To easily define a link to a file, the plugin supports copying the current
    file's path to a register when the `menu` key is pressed (by default the `b`
    register).

    To paste the path stored in register 'b' in insert mode:
>
        CTRL-R b
<
 Multi-line commands ~
    Multi-line commands can be set using the leading bar `|` character.
>
        m   ~/directory/or_file
            | echo 'foo'
            | echo 'bar'
<
 Commands only ~
    You can also define just a list of commands.

    For example, to copy a frequently used string to the clipboard:
>
        c1  | let @+ = "copy this string to the clipboard"
<
    To define some input from the shell tool:
>
        c2  | new _tmp_ | %! curl -sI example.com
<
 Stop command ~
    To stop a long list of commands while processing, press the `menu` key and
    input CTRL-C or an undefined key.

 Link reference ~
    You can use the `&` symbol to run other links.
>
        N   | NERDTreeCWD
        d   ~/directory | &N
<
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
